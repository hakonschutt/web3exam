# Task 2 - Pokemon REST API JSON (50%)

### Project info

The project is using a MVC design pattern for better code structure.

### Project structure

```
content/          -> HTML content pages
src/              -> Main src folder
  assets/         -> Images
  imports/        -> Project imports
```

### Project Spec

Create a Pokemon page that makes use of jQuery Ajax to retrieve JSON from the Pokemon REST API (links below).

Use some time first to get to know the Pokemon REST API and find out what type of information that is possible to get out from the API.

Requirements

- use Bootstrap to style the page
- use jQuery Ajax
- retrieve and display as much different types of information from the API (again: complexity and size of solutions affects the grade)
- have at least two buttons to generate different content, or variation of the content (for example display all of something, display more detailed information about one Pokemon etc.)

Some Pokemon REST API links:

- Main page: https://pokeapi.co/
- Example of an endpoint: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/
- Another example of an endpoint: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/34/
