# Web Development exam

## Part 1

Individual assignment Comments:
- The main technologies of this assignment are Bootstrap, jQuery Ajax methods, XML and JSON
- Notice that you will also be graded on things like code structure, tidiness, good use of comments in code etc.
- It is an assignment where complexity and size of solution is of importance to the grade.
- variation of techniques is good. For example if you have used navigation as buttons in one task, it is good to use another type of component in the other.
- It is the final version of this that you deliver at the end of the course together with Mappeinnlevering 2 that will count on the grade.
- This mappeinnlevering amounts to around* 30-35% of the total grade (* a precise number can't be given in a mappeinnlevering since it is the entire mappeinnlevering that is graded)
- If you are uncertain about something in the text, contact the teacher
- Put the tasks in 1 folder, which you zip/rar, before uploading.

<strong>Important!</strong> You will in this assignment use live services! Be respectful in the manner to not flood with calls, or you may experience that your IP address will be locked out! For example, neither use loops to call the services, nor make many repeated quick calls (for example with setInterval)!
