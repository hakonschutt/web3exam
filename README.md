# Web Development exam

## Part 1

Individual assignment Comments:

- The main technologies of this assignment are Bootstrap, jQuery Ajax methods, XML and JSON
- Notice that you will also be graded on things like code structure, tidiness, good use of comments in code etc.
- It is an assignment where complexity and size of solution is of importance to the grade.
- variation of techniques is good. For example if you have used navigation as buttons in one task, it is good to use another type of component in the other.
- It is the final version of this that you deliver at the end of the course together with Mappeinnlevering 2 that will count on the grade.
- This mappeinnlevering amounts to around* 30-35% of the total grade (* a precise number can't be given in a mappeinnlevering since it is the entire mappeinnlevering that is graded)
- If you are uncertain about something in the text, contact the teacher
- Put the tasks in 1 folder, which you zip/rar, before uploading.

<strong>Important!</strong> You will in this assignment use live services! Be respectful in the manner to not flood with calls, or you may experience that your IP address will be locked out! For example, neither use loops to call the services, nor make many repeated quick calls (for example with setInterval)!

### Task 1 - News Mashup - RSS Feed (RSS/XML) (50%)

In this task you will work with ajax to retrieve news sites' RSS (i.e. XML). You will create a web page where the user can through a menu (navigation bar and/or menu buttons) select news from different sources

### Task 2 - Pokemon REST API JSON (50%)

## Part 2

Overview

- In this assignment you will make use of the following main technologies:
  - React (front end)
    - Bootstrap
    - Ajax (jQuery and/or vanilla)
  - .NET/C# Web API (backend)
    - XML file(s) as the database
  - JSON: sent with Ajax call to Web API, and sent back to web page from the Web API
- You are creating two separate projects that interact:
  1.  A React project that sends Ajax calls to a Web API made by you (point 2 just below) to make the Web API perform CRUD operations
  1.  A Web API project that has an XML file (as a database) which it makes CRUD operations on
- What you are to deliver of files:
  - React: Only the public folder and the src folder; i.e. the folders containing the files where you code
  - Web API: The entire Web API project folder

### Task 1 - Police case

The police need an application to better handle their cases.
Make an application for the police to handle cases. They need to be able to register, delete, edit and display cases.
